 Ashes is perhaps the painting that shows us most clearly how Munch wanted to portray the dangers of love and sexuality. Eivu de Figuerredo is a historian and Munch's biographer. The woman is standing with her arms above her head. She's stretching while the man sits huddled in a corner. And we can well imagine that they just had sex. And given the title, Ashes, that is exactly what we're seeing. The ashes after the fire has burned out. If we look at the standing woman, we see that her hair is hanging down over her shoulders and extending in defiance of gravity towards the man's back. Kind of like the head of Medusa, whose hair looks like tentacles, or perhaps like electrical cables that are draining energy from the man. It's rare to find empty spaces in Munch's pictures. Instead, the spaces are filled with energies linking people to each other and to the surrounding nature. Sometimes these energies are vaguely represented as an atmosphere, with brushstrokes swirling around in the surface. But here, the energies are concentrated in the woman's hair. It's never a coincidence when Munch allows a woman's hair to touch a man like this. It suggests that they are connected by electrical forces, and that a woman is straining the man of energy.
