 It's rare in the history of art to experience a representation of naked male bodies without their sort of acting out classical stories or mythological scenes. Patricia Berman is a professor of art history at Wellesley College in Boston. She has published a number of books on monk. In this case, they're a group of bathers who stand on the beach, some of them looking at us quite directly, others jumping into the water, splashing in the water. And what we see is a scene literally of daily life made monumental by monk and by his inventiveness. So there are several things about this painting that really fascinate me. One is moving front to back. The figures in the foreground stand on a shoreline that itself is rounded. It reaches up toward both edges of the canvas and kind of reaches down in the center, which is a little bit unbalanced. So we see these figures from the front. And yet, when we look behind them, we seem to be looking down directly into the water. So the artist has really used two different perspectival ways of rendering this scene from the front and from the top. The other thing that intrigues me is the fact that over toward the right hand side, if you look at the figures that face us at the edge of the water, one figure has his hand on the other's thigh. And monk emphasized that by creating the sense that the figures have suntans on their heads and hands and the rest of their bodies are pale in comparison. And this gesture of whether it's male eroticism or comradeship really, I think, activates the composition and transforms it into something much more complicated than a group of men just sort of swimming on a summer's day.
