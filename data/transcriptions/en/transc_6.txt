 You're standing in front of one of the most famous images that Munch ever created, Madonna. What is it about this woman that makes her so fascinating to art lovers around the world? Let's ask Munch's biographer, Ivo di Figaro. When we look at Madonna, it's easy to imagine that we're looking at a woman reclining in a sexually provocative position. And then again, she's called Madonna. And we notice the red head covering that looks like a kind of phalo. So we can't tell for certain whether we are looking at a full Madonna or at a sanctified whore. It's hard to decide whether Munch wants to elevate a sexual image of a woman to make her holy into an icon, or whether he intends the opposite, to drag the Madonna down to a world of carnal desire. This ambivalence is inherent to this image, and probably both interpretations are true, depending on the viewer. The interpretation depends on the viewer. Might it depend on the gender of the viewer as well? Curator Kari Brantzeg sees Madonna as an image of female liberation. Munch was fascinated by the concept of free law. At that time, he was part of the Christiania's Bohemian society. Inspired by these thoughts, Munch socialized with a lot of very radical women at that time, who demanded that women should also be allowed to choose their lovers and take control of their own sexuality. This must definitely have inspired Munch to paint an image like Madonna, which shows a woman's need to be seen and her desire to be captured in a moment of ecstasy.
