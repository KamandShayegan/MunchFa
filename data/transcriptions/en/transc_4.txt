 Here we see a woman lying on a bed. Munch has given her a skirt and her hair is tumbling down on the pillow. Even though she's not naked, this woman caused quite a stir at the time when Munch created her. The version of the day after that you're looking at is a print version of the painting that Munch made of the same woman in 1894. The painting received an enormous amount of attention at the time and was considered something of a scandal. Curator Kari Bramsegg explains why. It's pretty obvious that she's had a visitor. We see the two glasses on the table, we see the two bottles half empty and then this naked arm hanging down by the mattress. The idea of a woman being portrayed like this after some kind of indecent behavior, perhaps involving a night time male visitor, was considered really outrageous. But I believe that Munch by exhibiting this image publicly in the 1890s helped to increase the understanding and acceptance of women. By showing them as independent beings with sexual desires and the right to decide for themselves who to spend the night with, he might actually have helped to promote women's liberation.
