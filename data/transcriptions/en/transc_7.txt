 Edvard Munch had experienced death in his close family from an early age. Eivul de Figaredo is a historian and the writer of Munch's biography. Munch's mother died when he was a young boy. Then, when he was 14, his sister Sophie died at the age of 15. Because of his own frequent illnesses, Munch himself lived with the fear of dying throughout his childhood. Munch might well have been thinking of his sister Sophie when he painted this picture. But it's not a biographical painting. Munch didn't document his own life in that way. Rather, by searching in his memories and his own experiences, he sought out the universal. By exploring his own grief, he managed to depict grief as such. Pay attention to how the whole picture is painted using visual tools that, in a way, turn it into an image of mourning. The scene is filled with grief. The mother's grief over losing her child, the child's grief about her impending death, and even our own grief. The descending brushstrokes, the dripping waves of color, it's as though we are watching the scene through our own veil of tears. In fact, we are part of the scene, allowed to invest our own grief in it.
